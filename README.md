## Spark:

Apache Spark is an open source analytics engine used for big data workloads. It can handle both batches as well as real-time analytics and data processing workloads.
Spark provides native bindings for the Java, Scala, Python, and R programming languages. In addition, it includes several libraries to support build applications for machine learning [MLlib], stream processing [Spark Streaming], and graph processing [GraphX]
